# We're Using GitHub Under Protest

Some of our projects are still hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have [our own git forge](https://git.radiostudent.si/) where the
project contributors are actively working.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects. You can also listen to [a radio show I made about it](https://radiostudent.si/druzba/tehno-klistir/mali-mehki-kplgit).

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[email us](podpora@radiostudent.si) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
